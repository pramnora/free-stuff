      <b>NOTE(1):</b> Some stuff is FREE.../other stuff...such as any added extra's...; then, one might need to 'pay' for that.

     <li>
      <b>NOTE(2):</b> At the time that I went and wrote it down here...these offers were still ongoing. However, it's perfectly possible that over time...; due to my not having gone and 'updated' certain links...; these site offers might have changed...; as in, no longer free, anymore/or, offer just simply stopped/site gone down/-etc.; therefore, I make no guarantee that any or all of these offers will still work...; you just have to take the page 'as is'.
     </li>

     <br><br>

     <li>
      <b>NOTE(3)</b>: Just in case, you were wondering...the honest answer is, no...I do not get <i>paid</i> to advertise any of these links...; instead, I just place links here inside of this page...purely as a record of my travels around the internet. Because, without writing it down somewhere...; then, I would <i>not</i> be able to remember <u>all</u> of the links to *free stuff*...which I did previously come across...most certainly, my memory is <b>not</b> that good...?!)-

     ChatGPT, is a powerful AI/Artificial Intelligence tool program...which is relatively straight forwards and simple to use...you just simply say whatever it is you want by typing in a statement such as: Write me a love sonnet poem/or, write me a play where someone finds their missing purse/or, write me a computer program using this or that programming language; and, the program just does it...often producing astounding results which comes back in only just mere 'seconds'. I think, it is very difficult indeed for anybody to completely 'ignore' what are the possible uses of AI...and/or, ChatGPT...; especially, when we are living in the computing age/too, the age of robotics.

However, if you wish to keep the same server 'up and running' for a whole month...; then, the minimum price for 'shared' hosting is $5.00 per month.

     Python, is a FREE programming language...which can be used both offline/online (in the form of DJango/PyScript). It is a very diverse programming language used to teach from 'beginner' programmers/up to experienced 'data scientists'. It also uses plenty of libraries...such as one can use it to do Logo turtle graphics programming/and, build OOP UI's using TKInter/-etc. It can also be used to do 'web scraping'/-etc. Consequently, Python is one of the most diverse 'general purpose' programming languages ever created with tons of different possible uses. At Python.org...it can even be used inside of the web browser itself.

     YouTube, is a site where one can go to either 'watch'/or else, 'upload' your own videos(it even has a built-in online editor). Mostly, people go there to learn, however...by searching to find any subject they please...; as they say, just 'one' picture is worth a 1000 words...; so, you can learn a lot of things much more quickly and easily by watching a video/than, having to go stick your nose into a 500+ page book...! Also, if learning from one video doesn't work...; you can also try finding another which you can understand a lot more easily.
